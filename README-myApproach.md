## Airport-Challenge

My goal for this project is to create a software that will manage planes landing and taking off for an Airport. It should be able adapt to weather conditions 'sunny' and 'stormy'.

+ When it's sunny planes should be able to land and take off
+ However, When it's stormy planes cannot land or take off

### The steps I am taking:

- [x] Create a functional representation of the first User-Story

- [x] Perform a feature test, analyse the errors and begin creating your first unit test.  

Now that I understand how I want my program to run, and have created my Airport object. Now lets create our Plane object and also test drive creating the land method for the Airport. Below are the TDD steps I followed to successfully do this:

Goal: Create the :land_plane method for the Airport class
- [x] Create a failing test to check if the airport object of class Airport responds to the method :land_plane
- [ ] Make the above test pass - then check if you can refactor your solution
- [ ] Next create a test to describe what kind of output :land_plane should produce - it should create a Plane instance
- [ ] Make this test pass and refactor

##Airport-Challenge

My goal for this project is to create a software that will manage planes landing and taking off for an Airport. It should be able adapt to weather conditions 'sunny' and 'stormy'.

+ When it's sunny planes should be able to land and take off
+ However, When it's stormy planes cannot land or take off

### The steps I am taking:

1. Create a functional representation of the first User-Story
2. Perform a feature test, analyse the errors and begin creating your first unit test.

##Airport-Challenge

My goal for this project is to create a software that will manage planes landing and taking off for an Airport. It should be able adapt to weather conditions 'sunny' and 'stormy'.

+ When it's sunny planes should be able to land and take off
+ However, When it's stormy planes cannot land or take off

### The steps I am taking:

[x] Create a functional representation of the first User-Story
[x] Perform a feature test, analyse the errors and begin creating your first unit test.  
[ ] Now that I understand how I want my program to run, and have created my Airport object. Now lets create our Plane object and also test drive creating the land method for the Airport.
